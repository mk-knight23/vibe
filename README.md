## What is VIBE?

VIBE CLI v0.0.1 is an **autonomous AI developer tool** that transforms how you build, test, and deploy software. It's a context-aware engine that executes complex engineering tasks with high precision, acting as a true teammate rather than just a chat interface.

**One command. One UI. Professional results.**

```bash
vibe> "scaffold a next.js app with auth and supabase"
vibe> "fix that flaky test in src/utils"
vibe> "refactor this module for better modularity"
vibe> "generate a github action for this project"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/mk-knight23/VIBE-CLI.git

## 🏗 Architecture

VIBE is built on **8 hardened core primitives**:

- **COMPLETION**: Universal LLM interface with multi-provider routing.
- **PLANNING**: Deterministic task decomposition via the `PlannerAgent`.
- **MULTI-EDIT**: Atomic, safe changes across multiple files.
- **EXECUTION**: Secure shell & script execution with status tracking.
- **SEARCH**: Context-aware codebase & web searching.
- **MEMORY**: Persistence of session decisions and architectural patterns.
- **APPROVAL**: Risk-based human-in-the-loop safety gates.
- **DETERMINISM**: Instant checkpoints and rollbacks (/undo).

## 🛡 Safety & Control

VIBE is designed to be **safe-by-default**:
- **Approvals**: Dangerous operations (file deletion, system commands) always require confirmation.
- **Checkpoints**: Automatic state snapshots before major changes.
- **Sandbox**: Optional isolated execution for untrusted commands.
- **Audit Logs**: Full traceability of all agent actions via `/logs`.

## 🔧 Configuration

Configure VIBE via the `/config` command or `.vibe/config.json`. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Local (Ollama) providers.
