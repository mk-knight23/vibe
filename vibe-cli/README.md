## 4. Architecture

Entry points:
- CLI binary router: [`vibe-cli/bin/vibe.cjs`](vibe-cli/bin/vibe.cjs:1)
- REPL / main orchestrator: [`vibe-cli/cli.cjs`](vibe-cli/cli.cjs:1)

Core domain folders:
- API key & model routing: [`vibe-cli/core/openrouter.ts`](vibe-cli/core/openrouter.ts:1), [`vibe-cli/core/apikey.ts`](vibe-cli/core/apikey.ts:1)
- Agent loop: [`vibe-cli/agent/agent.cjs`](vibe-cli/agent/agent.cjs:1)
- Codegen utilities: [`vibe-cli/code/codegen.cjs`](vibe-cli/code/codegen.cjs:1)
- Multi-edit engine: [`vibe-cli/edit/multiedit.cjs`](vibe-cli/edit/multiedit.cjs:1)
- Git helpers (diff, staging): [`vibe-cli/git/gittools.cjs`](vibe-cli/git/gittools.cjs:1)
- Refactor logic: [`vibe-cli/refactor/refactor.cjs`](vibe-cli/refactor/refactor.cjs:1)
- Debug tooling: [`vibe-cli/debug/debug.cjs`](vibe-cli/debug/debug.cjs:1)
- Test generation: [`vibe-cli/test/testgen.cjs`](vibe-cli/test/testgen.cjs:1)

### Data Flow

1. Command parsing (bin/vibe.cjs).
2. Task classification & model selection (`TASK_MODEL_MAPPING` in openrouter.ts).
3. Prompt assembly (context, safety filters).
4. OpenRouter API call (chatCompletion wrapper with retry/backoff).
5. Response parsing (diff blocks / actions).
6. Preview & confirmation (for mutating operations).
7. File application (atomic replace or patch).
8. Post-action logging + optional agent iteration.

### Safety Filter

Implemented inside REPL helper:
- `isDisallowedSecurityRequest` inside [`vibe-cli/cli.cjs`](vibe-cli/cli.cjs:1) rejects malicious or exploit-focused instructions (SQL injection crafting, zero-day generation, etc.).

## 5. Configuration & Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Auth for free model usage |
| `VIBE_NO_BANNER` | Suppress ASCII banner |
| `EDITOR` | External editor for multi-line inputs |

Internal config path (optional persisted key):
`~/.vibe/config.json` (contains sanitized fields only).

## 6. Model Selection

Default: `z-ai/glm-4-5-air:free`.

Task-based rotation (`TASK_MODEL_MAPPING`) selects best free model for:
- Code generation
- Review
- Refactor
- Debug

See mapping logic: [`vibe-cli/core/openrouter.ts`](vibe-cli/core/openrouter.ts:1).

## 7. Diff & Multi-File Edit Flow

Refactor / edit / generate operations produce fenced diff blocks:

```diff path=src/example.ts
- old line
+ new line
```

Flow:
1. Build list of candidate diffs.
2. Display summary (file count, total changed lines).
3. Confirm or abort.
4. Apply sequentially with validation (original content hash match).

Implementation:
- Diff building: [`vibe-cli/edit/multiedit.cjs`](vibe-cli/edit/multiedit.cjs:1)
- Git integration for staging: [`vibe-cli/git/gittools.cjs`](vibe-cli/git/gittools.cjs:1)

## 8. Agent Mode

Autonomous task runner:
```bash
vibe agent "Improve logging system" --auto
```
Loop:
1. Plan generation.
2. Action selection (generate/refactor/debug).
3. Safety gating.
4. Diff preview & apply (user confirm unless `--auto`).
5. Iteration until success criteria or max steps.

Agent core: [`vibe-cli/agent/agent.cjs`](vibe-cli/agent/agent.cjs:1).

## 10. Binary Build

Produces standalone executables (Linux, macOS, Windows):
```bash
npm run build:bin
```
Outputs:
- `dist/vibe-linux`
- `dist/vibe-macos`
- `dist/vibe-win.exe`

Workflow release packaging: `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## 11. Contributing

1. Fork repository.
2. Branch name: `feat/cli-<topic>` or `fix/cli-<issue>`.
3. Scoped commits prefixed with `vibe-cli:` for clarity.
4. Keep dependencies minimal (stdlib > packages).
5. Provide diff before/after summary for large edits.

## 12. Security Principles

- No persistence of API key beyond user control.
- Reject generation of exploit payloads.
- Diff gating for all file mutations (never silent writes).
- Limited context reading (explicit file patterns only).

## 13. Roadmap

| Area | Planned Improvement |
|------|----------------------|
| Testing | Add snapshot verification for codegen outputs |
| Agent | Introduce parallel subtask scheduling |
| Diff | Granular hunk application selection |
| Docs | Add per-command detailed help (`vibe help <command>`) |
| Metrics | Optional anonymized usage counters (opt-in) |

## 14. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "API key missing" | Set env `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `vibe config set openrouter.apiKey` |
| Empty response | Try different free model (`vibe model use deepseek/deepseek-coder-v2-lite-instruct:free`) |
| Diff apply fails | Ensure file unmodified since preview & re-run command |
| Binary build error | Check Node version >= 18 and rebuild after `npm ci` |

Verbose logging (temporary):
```bash
NODE_DEBUG=vibe vibe generate "..."
```
(Uses future planned log channel hook.)

## 15. Uninstall

Global:
```bash
npm uninstall -g vibe-cli
```

Local:
```bash
npm uninstall vibe-cli
```

Remove optional config directory if desired:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.vibe
```
