- Interactive onboarding wizard
- CLI Doctor / Diagnostics
- Secrets management
- PII scrubbing

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Workflow
- Smart command suggestions
- Multi-file intelligent editing enhancements
- Cost tracking & token analytics
- Enhanced code explanation

### Phase 4-5: Advanced Features

## What's Working

1. **Configuration System**
   - Hierarchical config resolution
   - Environment variable overrides
   - Schema validation
   - Theme configuration
   - Agent settings

2. **Existing Features** (from v12 baseline)
   - Checkpoint & rollback system
   - Code review & quality analysis
   - Semantic code search
   - MCP protocol support
   - Git integration
   - Multi-model support

---

## What's Not Working / Incomplete

1. **New Security Features**
   - Secrets management (secrets-manager.ts)
   - PII scrubbing (pii-scrubber.ts)
   - Shell integration (shell-integration.ts)
   - CLI Doctor (doctor.ts)
   - State management (state-manager.ts)
   - Onboarding wizard (onboarding.ts)

2. **Network Dependencies**
   - ajv/ajv-formats packages could not be installed (network issue)
   - Manual validation implemented as workaround

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete implementation of Phase 2-5 features
2. Install missing npm packages when network is available
3. Run full test suite to verify all tests pass

### Feature Priorities
1. **High Priority:**
   - Shell completion scripts
   - CLI Doctor / Diagnostics
   - Secrets Management

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Command history
   - Cost tracking
   - Onboarding wizard

3. **Lower Priority:**
   - Advanced enterprise features
   - Plugin system extensions
